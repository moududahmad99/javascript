Q. What are JavaScript data types?

Primitive types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint

Non-primitive type: object (which includes arrays, functions, etc.).

Q. Explain what == and === do in JavaScript.

== is the loose equality operator, which compares values after type coercion (e.g., 2 == '2' is true).

=== is the strict equality operator, which compares both value and type without type conversion (e.g., 2 === '2' is false).
